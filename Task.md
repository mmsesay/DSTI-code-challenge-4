# DSTI Coding Task

## What you will be creating

A small tool that visualises water stations on a map (Sierra Leone).

## Instructions

### Backend

- Create a server (preferably Node.js)
- A water station has the following properties:
    - ID number
    - Location ( Latitude & Longitude)
    - Type - Pumping Station, Dam, Community Pump, Well
    - Capcity - (The number of people this station is capable of serving)
- Your server should have an API that performs the following operations on your dataset
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete

### Frontend

- Visualise the list of water station on a map. Just their position on the map.
- Clicking on a water station should open a new route and display the information about that water station.

**Other**

- Should be able to filter water stations on the map.
- Design is totally up to you

**Bonus Points**

- Map focuses on Sierra Leone and its districts. Each district is layered with the colour blue whose shade depending on the number of water stations they have. The more water stations they have the darker the colour and vice versa.

End. Good luck :)
